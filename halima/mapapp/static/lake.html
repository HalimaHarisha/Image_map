    A lake is often a naturally occurring, relatively large and fixed body of water on or near
    the Earth's surface. It is localized in a basin or interconnected basins surrounded by dry land.
    Lakes lie completely on land and are separate from the ocean, although they may be connected with the 
    ocean by rivers.
